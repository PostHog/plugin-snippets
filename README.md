# PostHog Plugin Snippets

A collection of PostHog plugins that can be used by pasting the code and config into the Plugin Editor available in the PostHog UI.

**Note: All plugin snippets available here are in Beta mode!**

## Why Plugin Snippets?

Plugin snippets allow users to create flexible plugins that they can edit to better suit their needs. They are also useful while we improve the plugin versioning and updating functionality of our plugin server.

## How Do I Use Plugin Snippets?

1. Visit 'Project Plugins' under 'Settings'
2. Enable plugins if you haven't already done so
3. Click '+ Install new plugin'
4. Type in a name for the plugin under 'Write The Code' and click 'Start Coding'
5. When the editor opens, paste the contents of the `plugin.js` file under 'Source Code' and the contents of `config.json` under 'Config Schema JSON'
6. Hit 'Save' and the configuration options will appear for you to fill in
7. Fill in the configuration options and hit 'Save' again
8. Enable your plugin and you're good to go!
