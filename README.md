# PostHog Plugin Snippets

A collection of PostHog plugins that can be used by pasting the code and config into the Plugin Editor available in the PostHog UI.

**Note:** All plugin snippets available here are in Beta mode!

## Why Plugin Snippets?

Plugin snippets allow users to create flexible plugins that they can edit to better suit their needs. They are also useful while we improve the plugin versioning and updating functionality of our plugin server.
